python users.py
python courses.py
python enrollments.py
python lessons.py
python assignments.py
python submissions.py
```

## 🤩 Features

### ✅ Seeders
- Generates realistic dummy data using `faker`
- Inserts into respective collections with schema validation and integrity checks

### 🔄 CRUD Operations
- Add, read, update, and delete users, courses, lessons, enrollments, assignments, and submissions
- Supports soft deletes (e.g., deactivate user)

### 📊 Aggregation Pipelines
- Average course rating
- Total students per instructor
- Revenue per instructor
- Student engagement
- Completion rates
- Monthly enrollment trends

### 🔍 Advanced Queries
- Search/filter courses by tags, category, and title
- Filter users by date joined or activity
- Time-based lookups for due dates or grades

### ⚡ Indexing & Performance
- Indexes added for email, title, category, dueDate, courseId, and studentId
- Includes `.explain()`-based performance insights

## 🧪 Example Commands

### Seed Data:
```bash
python users.py
python courses.py
```

### Add a Lesson to a Course:
```python
from lessons import add_lesson_to_course
add_lesson_to_course(course_id='your-course-id')
```

### Get Top Students:
```python
from submissions import top_performing_students
```

### Search Courses:
```python
from courses import search_courses_by_title
search_courses_by_title("python")
```

## 📌 Notes
- All timestamps are stored in UTC without microseconds using `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(timespec='seconds')`
- All `UUIDs` are generated using `uuid4()`
- Validators ensure strict data integrity in each collection
